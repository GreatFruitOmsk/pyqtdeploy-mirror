These are various notes, instructions and reminders for the pyqtdeploy
developer.


Updating pyqtdeploy When New New Versions of Python are Released
================================================================

Run the ``diff-py-version.py`` script for the new version of Python::

    ./diff-py-version.py --sources /path/to/Python/sources X.Y.Z

This will generate a number of standard diffs in the current directory.


python_metadata.py
------------------

Add the new Python version to the appropriate supported branch.


Modules
-------

Check the ``Lib`` diff for any new or removed ``import`` statements and update
the Python standard library meta-data accordingly.


pyconfig.h
----------

Check the ``PC/pyconfig.h`` diff for any changes.  If there are then copy it to
the ``configurations/pyconfig`` directory with an appropriate version number.
Edit the file, comment out ``#define WITH_DOC_STRINGS``, add
``#define Py_NO_ENABLE_SHARED`` and replace the ``#define`` for
``HAVE_DYNAMIC_LOADING`` with ``@PY_DYNAMIC_LOADING@``.

Check the ``pyconfig.h.in`` diff for any new configuration items.  Add any new
ones to ``pyconfig.py``.


setup.py
--------

Check the ``setup.py`` diff for any changes and update the Python module
meta-data accordingly.


python.pro
----------

Check the ``Makefile`` diff:

    compare the value of ``PARSER_OBJS`` with the value of ``PARSER_SOURCES``
    in ``python.pro``

    compare the value of ``OBJECT_OBJS`` with the value of ``OBJECT_SOURCES``
    in ``python.pro``

    compare the value of ``PYTHON_OBJS`` with the value of ``PYTHON_SOURCES``
    in ``python.pro`` (ignoring ``frozen.o``)

    compare the value of ``MODULE_OBJS`` with the value of ``MODULE_SOURCES``
    in ``python.pro``

    compare the value of ``MODOBJS`` with the value of ``MOD_SOURCES`` in
    ``python.pro``.


_bootstrap.py
-------------

For Python v3, check the ``Lib/importlib/_bootstrap.py`` diff.  If there are
any differences then copy it to the builder with a version dependent name.


_bootstrap_external.py
----------------------

For Python v3, check the ``Lib/importlib/_bootstrap_external.py`` diff.  If
there are any differences then copy it to the builder with a version dependent
name.  Update the copy with the pyqtdeploy additions (normally just appended to
the file).
