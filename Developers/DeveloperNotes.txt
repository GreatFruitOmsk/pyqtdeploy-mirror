These are various notes, instructions and reminders for the pyqtdeploy
developer.


Updating pyqtdeploy When New Package Versions are Released
==========================================================

These notes assume that immediately prior releases are fully supported by
pyqtdeploy.

Also the package configurations assume the latest versions of Riverbank
packages are being used (whatever they happen to be).


Python
------

Patches
.......

Note that this is only necessary for versions of Python prior to v3.6.0.

Change to the source directory of the new Python version and run::

    pyqtdeploycli --package python --target android-32 configure

If the patches apply without error then there is nothing to do.

If the patches fail because of cosmetic changes then consider updating the
code that applies the patches to cope.

Otherwise generate a new set of patches in the patches directory.


Modules
.......

``diff`` the ``Lib`` directory, look for any new or removed ``import``
statements and update the Python standard library meta-data accordingly.


pyconfig.h
..........

For Windows see if there are any changes to ``PC/pyconfig.h``.  If so then copy
it to the ``configurations/pyconfig`` directory with an appropriate version
number.  Edit the file, add ``#define Py_NO_ENABLE_SHARED`` and replace the
``#define`` for ``HAVE_DYNAMIC_LOADING`` with ``@PY_DYNAMIC_LOADING@``.

For other platforms ``diff`` the ``pyconfig.h.in`` file to see if there are any
new configuration items.  Add any new ones to ``pyconfig.py``.


setup.py
........

See if there are any changes to ``setup.py`` and update the Python module
meta-data accordingly.


python.pro
..........

Run ``./configure`` for the new version and inspect the generated ``Makefile``.

Compare the value of ``PARSER_OBJS`` with the value of ``PARSER_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.

Compare the value of ``OBJECT_OBJS`` with the value of ``OBJECT_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.

Compare the value of ``PYTHON_OBJS`` with the value of ``PYTHON_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.  Note that ``frozen.o`` should be ignored.

Compare the value of ``MODULE_OBJS`` with the value of ``MODULE_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.

Compare the value of ``MODOBJS`` with the value of ``MOD_SOURCES`` in
``python.pro``.


_bootstrap_external.py
......................

For Python v3, check if ``Lib/importlib/_bootstrap_external.py`` has any
changes and update the builder's version if necessary.


supported_python_versions.py
............................

Update the object describing supported versions if the new version required
version-specific changes to the meta-data.


Qt
--

There should be nothing to do.


SIP
---

There should be nothing to do.


PyQt5
-----

Changes are only required if a new PyQt5 module has been added.

Update the ``pyqt_modules`` entries in the PyQt5 configuration files.  If the
release supports a new Qt v5.x.0 release (with new modules) then create a new
section ``[Qt 5.x]``.  If the release supports a new Python module for an
existing Qt library then update the existing section.

Consider if the ``pyqt_disabled_features`` entry needs updating.  If so then
also update the QScintilla, PyQt3D, PyQtChart, PyQtDataVisualization and
PyQtPurchasing configuration files.

Add the new modules to the metadata defined in ``pyqt5.py``


PyQt4
-----

There should be nothing to do.


QScintilla
----------

There should be nothing to do.


PyQt3D
------

There should be nothing to do.


PyQtChart
---------

There should be nothing to do.


PyQtDataVisualization
---------------------

There should be nothing to do.


Deploying to Android
====================

Configuring the Environment
---------------------------

To configure the environment (assuming an OS/X host), run::

    export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/path/to/android-ndk-r11c
    export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/android-sdk-macosx
    export PATH=/path/to/apache-ant-x.y.z/bin:$PATH

To use a specific Android API level (n) rather than the default 9, run::

    export ANDROID_NDK_PLATFORM=android-n

For Python v3.6.0 and later it must be set to 21 as a minimum.

Qt and the Android NDK may not agree on the toolchain version to use.  To force
Qt to use a particular version, run::

    export ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION=X.Y


Building a sysroot
------------------

To build a new sysroot, run::

    build-sysroot.py --target android-32 --clean --debug --all

To make the sysroot the default, run::

    rm /path/to/sysroot
    ln -s sysroot-android-32 /path/to/sysroot


Creating an Android Virtual Device
----------------------------------

To start the AVD Manager, run::

    $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/android avd

For any device ensure that ``Use Host GPU`` is enabled.


Building the .apk
-----------------

Once the application has been built (i.e. after running ``make``) then run::

    make install INSTALL_ROOT=deploy

To create a debug .apk, run::

    /path/to/X.Y/android_arm7/bin/androiddeployqt \
            --input android-lib*.so-deployment-settings.json \
            --output deploy

``QtApp-debug.apk`` can be found in the ``deploy/bin`` directory.


Deploying the .apk
------------------

When the AVD is running, run::

    $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools/adb install QtApp-debug.apk


Debugging Tips
--------------

Use ``qDebug()`` in debugging statements so that the output can be seen by
``adb logcat``.

The adb server can be flakely.  If ``adb devices`` doesn't show anything then
run::

    $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools/adb kill-server
    $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools/adb start-server


Deploying to iOS
================

Building a sysroot
------------------

To build a new sysroot, run::

    build-sysroot.py --target ios-64 --clean --debug --all

To make the sysroot the default, run::

    rm /path/to/sysroot
    ln -s sysroot-ios-64 /path/to/sysroot


Deploying the .app
------------------

Deployment is done using Xcode.  Make sure any code signing problems are
resolved (ie. click on ``Fix issues`` in the ``Identity`` section if
necessary).

To deploy to a device, select::

    Product -> Perform Action -> Run Without Building
